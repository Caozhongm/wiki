    2. Add a button to show all connectable device. Prevent users from being unable to connect to the device when using a USB-to-serial chip that is not included.
    3. Add file associations for .ob project file.

- **Fix bug**
    1. Severe freeze after switching targets several times.
    2. The remote resource update address configuration error caused the program to crash after clicking the Check Update button.
    3. The remote resource update address incorrectly uses openblockcc instead of the address in the configuration.
    4. When the blocks nested inside the blocks in the toolbox are in the workspace, the internal blocks are erroneously disabled when the disabled state is updated.
    5. An error is reported after opening multiple windows: the address is already in use.

## v2.1.0

- **New feature**
    1. Change arduino build tool from arduino-builder to arduino-cli.
    2. Add remote upgrade function for external extension and device.
    3. Modify the default sprite to Demon Bird.
    4. Add arduino esp32 board support.
    5. Add microbit V2 board support.
    6. Add clear cache button.
    7. Add install driver button.
    8. Move the real-time mode connection indicator to the stage head.
    9. Add localization for desktop alters.
    10. Add timeout error in upload modal. If it gets stuck for tens of seconds, it will show timeout error, allow users to click the close button but not stuck forever.
    11. Add arduino uno ultra base board to support customized board witch A6 A7 pins.
    12. Optimize the external extension and device framwork.
    13. Optimize the firmware files structure.
    14. Optimize the serialport framwork. Prevent interface freeze caused by receiving high-speed serialport data.
    15. Add QDP ROBOT C02 kit(arduino esp32).

- **Fix bug**
    1. Stuck at the upload modal if unplug the usb cable while in arduino build progress.
    2. Unplug the usb cable while in arduino upload progress, the gui does not disconnect the device. User could still click the upload button and then will stuck in upload modal.
    3. Uploading the program or firmware after connecting and disconnecting the device several times will cause the real-time mode communication bug.
    4. After the upload is successful, if user do not close the upload window, unplug the usb cable, it will display upload failure.

## v2.0.0

- **New feature**
    1. Add serilport console.
    2. Separate third party device from bundle pack. now support modify third party device without rebuild the project.
    3. Optimize the block's disable logic in different programming modes.
    4. Now in realtime mode, you can select the realtime mode extension.
    5. If a block is not connected into the effective tree. it's setup and define and others code will not generate.
    6. Optimize the structure of the code generated by Arduino code generator to make it more consistent with Arduino native code format.
    7. The project file will save the current programming mode and automatically switch to the saved mode after loading.
    8. In programming mode, blocks can no longer be click executed and glow.
    9. After the realtime mode communication is successfully established, there will be no atert. Instead, it will indicate whether the communication is successful by dimming the communication icon on the right side of the connection icon. A alter will pop up and prompt to download the real-time mode firmware only after the communication attempt fails.
    10. After the firmware is downloaded and the real-time communication is established successfully, the alert of real-time mode failure warning will automatically disappear.

- **Fix bug**
    1. When loading a project file with multiple large extensions, the toolbar area will repeatedly display the contents of multiple extensions, and some other errors.
    2. The button to download firmware is not disabled when there is no connected device.
    3. Shorten the window of upload to fix the problem of incomplete display on some pc.
    4. Fixed a number of potential problems with realtime mode communication.
    5. The code window is not re rendered after resizing, resulting in a missing display.
    6. After switching programming mode, the sprite will disappear in some times.
    7. Arduino and microbit do not hide all the unsupported building blocks in programming mode.
    8. Microbit's buttonIsPressed block transcoding function should have written n for b when button is B.
    9. Microbit custom variable name exception.
    10. Arduino UNO mega2560 serial port 0 translation code is incorrect.
    11. Number parsing error of data_changevariableby block.
    12. Cancel the 1.05x interface zoom setting and directly enlarge the font to fix the problem of blurred font in the toolbar menu.

## v1.2.2beta

- **New feature**
    1. Add hide code stage button.
    2. Change the ui of upload button.
    3. Change the description of some boards.
    4. Add a 1.05 scale to fix the problem of fuzzy font.
    5. Change project file extension from .sb3 to .ob.

- **Fix bug**
    1. Microbit generator error.
    2. The pin menu of arduino set digital out does not have analog pin items.
